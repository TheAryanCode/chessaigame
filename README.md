# chessaigame

Welcome to the **Chess AI Project**! This repository contains a powerful AI designed to challenge even the most seasoned chess players. With various strategies and algorithms under the hood, this AI is ready to take on all challengers. The key components of this project include:

- 🧠 **Agent.py**: The brain behind the AI, handling decision-making and strategy.
- 🤖 **ChessAI.py**: Implements the AI’s logic and gameplay algorithms.
- ⚙️ **ChessEngine.py**: The core engine that governs the rules and state of the game.
- 🎮 **ChessMain.py**: The main script that brings everything together into a playable game.

## Features ✨

- **AI-Powered Chess**: Challenge an AI that adapts to your gameplay.
- **Move Validation**: Ensures every move is legit and according to chess rules.
- **Interactive GUI**: (If applicable) Play through a user-friendly graphical interface.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Adjust the AI’s difficulty to match your skill level.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Advanced techniques for smooth and responsive gameplay.

## Installation 🛠️

Follow these steps to set up and start playing:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheAryanCode/chessaigame.git  
   cd chessaigame
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install any additional libraries required:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```

3. **Run the game**:  
   Launch the game with:  
   ```bash
   python ChessMain.py  
   ```

## File Structure 🗂️

- **Agent.py**: The mastermind behind AI decisions, including strategy and move generation.
- **ChessAI.py**: Implements core AI logic with algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.
- **ChessEngine.py**: Handles all the chess rules, game states, and move validation.
- **ChessMain.py**: The main script that kicks off the game and integrates all components.

## How It Works 🧩

### AI Decision-Making 🧠

The AI evaluates the chessboard using heuristics to choose the best move. It utilizes algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning to make optimal decisions and outmaneuver its opponent.

### Game Engine ⚙️

The ChessEngine.py script is the backbone of the game, managing:

- Initial board setup and game state
- Rule enforcement and move validation
- Player turns and game flow

### Main Interface 🎮

ChessMain.py serves as the game's entry point, integrating the AI, game engine, and user interface for a smooth experience.

## Customization 🎨

Make the game your own:

- **Adjust Difficulty**: Tweak the AI's complexity in ChessAI.py to match your skill level.
- **Modify Rules**: Customize the game rules in ChessEngine.py for variant chess games.
- **Enhance the UI**: If using a graphical interface, add new features or improve existing ones.
